## Introduction

This week you will be working on Javascript fundamentals to practice what you have learned. You will be given prompts to guide you and you should read the prompts carefully.

<i>Toddobaadkan waxaad ka shaqayn doontaa Javascript aasaasiga ah si aad ugu dhaqanto waxaad baratay. Waxaa lagu siin doonaa tilmaamo ku haga oo waa inaad si taxadar leh u akhrido tilmaamaha.</i>

Assignments are outlined in the `fizzbuzz_in_space.js`, `ice_or_fire_weather_station.js`, `mood_tracker _app.js`, `space_countdown.js`,  `the_odd_detective.js`, and `time_machine.js` files, please read the instructions carefully for each task and complete it. Note that you may have to use your googling skills to research and look things up if you do not have all the information you need to complete the task.

<i>Howsha lagaa rabo inaa qabato waxay ku jirtaa `fizzbuzz_in_space.js`, `ice_or_fire_weather_station.js`, `mood_tracker _app.js`, `space_countdown.js`,  `the_odd_detective.js`, iyo `time_machine.js`. Fadlan si taxadar leh u akhri tilmaamaha halkaas ku xusan. Waad isticmaali kartaa Google si aad ooga shaqeyso assignment-ga.</i>

## Instructions

## Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

**Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:**

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Gabi's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch.
- [ ] After making changes, type `git add .` to add changes.
- [ ] Commit your changes: `git commit -m "add message here"`
- [ ] Push commits: `git push -u origin firstName-lastName`.
- [ ] Create Pull Request
- [ ] Submit your assignment.
  
## Task 2: MVP / Waxa ugu yar oo lagaa rabo

Find the `ice_or_fire_weather_station.js`, `mood_tracker _app.js`, `space_countdown.js`,  `the_odd_detective.js`, and `time_machine.js`  files and complete the tasks as they're written in there. 

<i>File-sha `ice_or_fire_weather_station.js`, `mood_tracker _app.js`, `space_countdown.js`,  `the_odd_detective.js`, and `time_machine.js`  hel, kadib ka shaqee.</i>

As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.

<i>`console.log` isticmaal si aad u ogaato inay wax kuu shaqeynayaan.</i>

## Task 3: Stretch Goals / Shaqo dheeraad ah - Fadlan ha bilaabin shaqadaan adigoon mida kore dhameynin.

After you have completed the requirements, try any of the following challenges. As always, note that these may require additional research beyond what you learned in this module.

- [ ] Finish the challenge in `fizzbuzz_in_space.js`
- [ ] Create UI for challenges with prompts.
