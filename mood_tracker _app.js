/*
Task: Mood Checker

You are designing a basic mood tracker app. Write a script that:

1. Prompts the user to share how they feel today (e.g., happy, sad, tired).
2. If the user enters "happy", console.log("I'm glad to hear that!").
3. If the user enters "sad", console.log("I'm sorry, hope you feel better soon.").
4. If the user enters "tired", console.log("Make sure to get some rest.").
5. For any other input, console.log("Thank you for sharing how you feel.").

BONUS:
Make it case-insensitive so that inputs like "Happy" or "HAPPY" are handled correctly.
