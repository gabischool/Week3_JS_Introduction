Task: FIZZBUZZ

You are an astronaut exploring Planet FizzBuzz. The inhabitants communicate using a strange counting system:

1. Print numbers from 1 to 50.
2. For multiples of 3, the aliens say "Fizz" instead of the number.
3. For multiples of 5, they say "Buzz".
4. For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, they say "FizzBuzz".

Your mission: Translate their counting system to console logs so humans can understand!



Extra Credit:
Count how many "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" translations you encounter and print the totals.
