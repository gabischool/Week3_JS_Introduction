Task: Odd or Even

You’re a detective investigating a mysterious code. Your clue is a number that could be odd or even.

1. Declare a variable with the number 27 (or another number of your choice).
2. Write an if/else statement to check if the number is odd or even.
3. If it’s odd, console.log("This number is odd. The thief is tricky!").
4. If it’s even, console.log("This number is even. The thief is neat!").
